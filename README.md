# Or-gambling

Make your way to the finish line, but watch your dopamine levels, as they’ll keep dropping. To counter this, you can gamble, but each bet costs 20k Jetons. If you run out of Jetons, you can sell body parts for 60k Jetons—but beware, it comes with some debuffs. Eliminating enemies will regenerate a small amount of dopamine aswell.
